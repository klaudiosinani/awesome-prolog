### Submitting a Pull Request

- Non-trivial changes are often best discussed in an issue first, to prevent you from doing unnecessary work
- Use a descriptive title for the pull request and commits
- You might be asked to do changes to your pull request, you can do that by just [updating the existing one](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md)
